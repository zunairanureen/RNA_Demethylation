## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts resources, documentation, and supporting materials for the research project:

**“Targeted mRNA Demethylation in Maize Using an Engineered dCas13b-ALKBH5 Fusion Protein.”**

The project pioneers a **CRISPR–Cas13b–based epitranscriptomic tool (dm6ACRISPR)** to precisely manipulate **m6A RNA methylation** in maize. By fusing a catalytically inactive **dPspCas13b enzyme** with the **m6A demethylase ALKBH5**, we aim to enable **site-specific RNA demethylation**, offering new insights into maize gene regulation, crop resilience, and biotechnology applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop and validate a **CRISPR–Cas13b–ALKBH5 fusion system (dm6ACRISPR)** for maize.
* Enable **locus-specific demethylation** of mRNA transcripts (e.g., WUS, STM, FT, SPL3, SPL9).
* Investigate how **m6A RNA modifications** regulate:

  * mRNA stability
  * Translation efficiency
  * Gene expression under stress conditions
* Explore **biotechnological applications** for crop improvement, stress tolerance, and yield enhancement.
